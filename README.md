# 3DPrinter-2025
This is a printer I made as a part of hack club's highway project.



## Base Goals
- On average, the printer should perform at the level of the **Bambu A1 Mini** or at least the **Ender 3 V2**.
- **Print Quality & Speed** should be comparable to the Bambu A1 Mini.
- It should feature **fully automatic bed leveling**.
- I should be able to **control it fully remotely**.
- The printer should have a **video camera** for monitoring.
- It should be **reasonably silent**:
  - **From the kitchen:** I shouldn't hear it at all.
  - **From my room:** It should be nearly silent.

## Specific Requirements
- **Hotend Temperature** – Should heat to at least **300°C** for exotic filaments.
- **Bed Temperature** – Should reach at least **80°C**, but should be able to support ABS without additional resources (though this is not strictly required).
- **Enclosure** – Although not prioritized due to flexibility and unneeded size, I will **consider** an enclosure.

**This took about 2 hours to decide, although its a basic list.**
